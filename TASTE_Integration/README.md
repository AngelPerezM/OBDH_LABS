TASTE Integration
=================

Implementation of the [OBDH system](https://github.com/STR-UPM/OBDH_LABS/tree/master/PROJECT)
using the [TASTE toolchain](https://taste.tools/).

TASTE is a toolchain supported and developed by the European Space Agency together
with academics and European space industry partners.
This tool follows a Component-Based Development (CBD) approach and automatic
